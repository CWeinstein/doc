		<u> jakeJ14:</u> <b> Rating: 4 stars. </b> Doctor Johnson is an extremely caring doctor and she is very organized. She has great hours and is very easy to contact and schedule an appointment with. Would recommend her to just about anyone.

		<u> jessicaaa18: </u> <b> Rating: 3 stars. </b> Doctor Johnson is a very fun and engaging doctor, although I have had some problems with scheduling appointments because many slots are often full. Try scheduling appointments in the middle of the week, when others are busy.
